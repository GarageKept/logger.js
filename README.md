<h1>
    logger.js
</h1>

<div>
    Ever had to write a new logging system to change where your logs go? Or, needed to write to multiple sources at once and didn't want to reinvent the wheel yet again?
</div>
<h4>
    Enter logger.js
</h4>
<div>
   Write your logging hooks one time, with scope mind you, and manage the data sources on the back end. 
</div>
<div>
    logger.js is fully extensible from the start. The console module is already provided to write effective logs to the console from the start. If you need additional modules, such as application insights, add them in, configure them as you need and go.

    Need a logging source not currently available, roll your own by following our examples.
